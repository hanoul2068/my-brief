      "summary": "The economist Paul Krugman once said, “Productivity isn’t everything, but in the long run, it’s almost everything”. When workers can produce more value in the same amount of time, economies can grow faster, and living standards can rise. The chart shows the productivity metric published by the Penn World Table for South Korea and Japan. It measures gross domestic product (GDP) per hour of work. Since 2000, South Korea’s productivity has more than doubled, narrowing what was once a vast gap with Japan. It has now even surpassed its neighbor."

      "published_at": "2025-12-18T00:00:00.000Z",
      "summary": "What does the British government spend its budget on? The chart shows spending broken down by category, scaled to £100. It combines both central and local government spending. Social protection is the single largest item. Out of every £100 spent, £33 goes to it — more than health, at £19 per £100. The UK is typical in this regard — in every OECD country except the US , social protection is the biggest category. Public services also account for a large share: £14 per £100."

Living conditions in these countries have improved more broadly. Poverty rates are lower , and life satisfaction is higher . Incomes have not just doubled in terms of GDP per capita; median incomes have also doubled. Read more from my colleague Max Roser about economic growth, how it’s measured, and why it matters."

China is the top source of imports for many countries . But this tells us only how China compares with other trading partners, not how large these imports are relative to the size of each country’s economy. That is what this map shows. The map plots the total value of merchandise imports from China as a share of each importing country’s GDP."

China’s central role in merchandise trade is the result of a large change that has taken place in just a few decades. This change has been especially large in Africa and South America. In 1990, most African countries imported mainly from Europe, and most South American imports came from North America."
